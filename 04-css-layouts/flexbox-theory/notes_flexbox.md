# Flexbox

- flexbox is a set of related CSS properties for building 1-dimensional layouts
- the main idea behind flexbox is that empty space inside a container element can be automatically divided by its child elements
- flexbox makes it really easy to automatically align items to one another inside a parent container, both horizontally and vertically
- therefore flexbox solves common problems such as vertical centering and creating equal-height columns
- flexbox is perfect for replacing floats, allowing us to write fewer and cleaner HTML and CSS code
