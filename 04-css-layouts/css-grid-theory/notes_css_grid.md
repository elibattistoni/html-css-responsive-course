# CSS Grid

CSS Grid is the most modern way of building layouts, and it is also the most complete one. If you use only the fundamentals, it is even the easiest way.

Like with flexbox, with CSS grid we have grid containers and grid items.


- CSS Grid is a set of CSS properties for building 2-dimensional layouts
- the main idea behind CSS Grid is that we divide a container element into rows and columns that can be filled with its child elements
- in two-dimensional contexts, CSS Grid allows us to write less nested HTML and easier-to-read CSS
- CSS Grid is not meant to replace Flexbox; instead they work perfectly together. Need a 1D layout? use flexbox. Need a 2D layout? use CSS Grid


GRID CELLS == the cells created by the grid lines; grid cells might be filled by a grid item or not

we can create spaces between grid items, and these are called GUTTERS or GAPS

GRID TRACK (row track, column track) a grid track can be a row or a column
