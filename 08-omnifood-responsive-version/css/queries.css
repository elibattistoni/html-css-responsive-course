/*
our design starts to break at around 1300px
and there is also an extremely common screen size at 1366px
(the so called HD-ready screens)

NB like we don't use px in the layout, we SHOULD NOT USE PX FOR MEDIA QUERIES
because pixels will not adjust to the user's font size setting in the browser and also not to the user's zooom level

IMPORTANT however the responsive units in media queries do not respond to this font size setting in the HTML 
(i.e. to the root element font size)
==> i.e in media queries, 1 rem != 10px; 1 rem = the default font size browser setting
==> em and rem do not depend on html font-size in media queries!
==> instead, we assume that 1 rem == 1 rem == 16px
NB rem has some bugs in some browsers when used in media queries, therefore in media queries we should not use rem but em

NB when building a responsive design, you should start at the top, i.e. at the biggest width, and then make it smaller and smaller and keep adjusting whenever the design breaks
NB obviously if you build mobile first, you will work in the smae way but starting from the smallest width and then make it bigger and bigger

/* when shrinking the page with the dev tool in the broswers, we chose to set a first breakpoint between 1300 and 1366 px */
/* so let's choose 1350px */
/* to convert that to em we simply do divide it by 16px: 1350 / 16 = 84 (rounded up) */
/* 84 * 16 = 1344 */
@media (max-width: 84em) {
  .hero {
    max-width: 120rem;
    /* NB this rem has nothing to do with that em, it works exactly as before in general.css */
  }

  /* since the heading became of 4 rows, let's decrease it as well; in general.css it is 5.2rem (i.e. 52px) */
  /* therefore let's try to step it down to the value below */

    font-size: 4.4rem;

  /* IMPORTANT BEST PRACTICE: do not add too many media queries; you should not add 10 or 15 media queries to fix every single problem */
  /* so we will use our media query, the breakpoint that we already have, and we will switch the 3 columns layout of the gallery to 2 columns */
