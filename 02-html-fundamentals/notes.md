# About **bold** text
- <b></b> is an old HTML and not good practice (it has no semantic meaning)

# About *italic* text
- <i></i> old
- <em></em> best practice


# Open a link in another tab with `target="_blank"`
## Hyperlink == Link == Anchor

# <aside>
The aside element is usually used for some secondary information that complements the information in the main part of the page
